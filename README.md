:raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: In this project, I explored the features and derived insights of data, then created a model to predict post-test scores.

:page_facing_up: Data is from Kaggle, see it <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kwadwoofosu/predict-test-scores-of-students">here</a>

:gear: I used Python libraries `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn`. requirements.txt contains more detailed information about tools used.
