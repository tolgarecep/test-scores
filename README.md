<h3>Predictive analysis on dataset of test scores of students from various schools :man_student:</h3> 

:raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: In `test-scores.ipynb`; <br><br>
• I explored students' schools, where schools set, what teaching method classrooms use, size of classrooms, genders, whether students qualified for reduced/free lunch or not and correlations among these features. I visualized my analyses.

• I built models to predict post-test scores, which turned out to be highly correlated with pretest scores. I used linear regression (and ridge & lasso), support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors.

:page_facing_up: Data is from Kaggle, you can see it <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kwadwoofosu/predict-test-scores-of-students">here</a> or download `test_scores.csv` right from the repo.

:gear: I used Python libraries `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn`. requirements.txt contains more detailed information about tools used.
